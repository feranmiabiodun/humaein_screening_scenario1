# humaein_screening_scenario1
a compact pipeline to ingest messy EMR claim exports, unify their schema, classify denial reasons (heuristics + mocked LLM), and surface automated resubmission candidates with audit-ready outputs. Includes a documented Jupyter notebook (canonical, for review) and a runnable pipeline.py (CLI + fuzzy ingestion, metrics, and rejection logging).
